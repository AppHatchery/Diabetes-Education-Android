                <li>Lantus/Levemir/Basaglar/Triseba/Semglee</li>

        <h3>Rapid-acting insulin</h3>
        <p>Signs of diabetes occur because the body lacks insulin. This causes blood sugar to build up in the blood, leading to these signs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Humalog/Novolog/Ademelog/Fiasp.</li>
            <li>These all work similarly, and will be prescribed based on patient’s insurance</li>

            <li>Taken when food is eaten as well as when the blood sugar rises during the day</li>
            <li> Food coverage with insulin to prevent the high blood sugar that the carbohydrates in
                the food cause</li>
            <li>When blood sugars are elevated to bring the blood sugar into target range</li>

        <h3>Storage of Insulin</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Insulin will not work if it is not stored properly. It is usually good for 28 to 30 days after you open the bottle as long as it is stored properly</li>
            <li>Always check the expiration date on the vial before you use it. Throw it away if it is expired.</li>
            <li>Store insulin in a cool, dry place. Do not store it in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Write the date that you open it on the bottle. Use it to remind you of when to throw it away.</li>
            <li>Store the insulin the way the manufacturer’s instructions tell you to do so or as advised by your doctor. Ask your diabetes team about the storage rules for insulin pumps and pens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Injection Sites</h3>
        <p>Rotation</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change the site where you give the shots each time.</li>
            <li>Make up a chart or a simple system to keep track of the different places you use. For instance, you may want to use your right arm for breakfast insulin, your left arm for lunch insulin, your stomach for dinner and your buttock for bedtime.</li>
            <li>Rotate places within each site. If not, your body might make scar tissue, or lumps, under the skin. The scarring can keep insulin from being absorbed well.</li>
        </ul>
