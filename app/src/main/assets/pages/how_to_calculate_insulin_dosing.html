        <h3>Long-acting insulin.</h3>
        <p>Long-acting insulin (Lantus/Levemir/Basaglar/Triseba/Semglee)- It is a set dose prescribed by your care team. The same dose of this insulin is given at the same time, every day regardless of what blood sugar is. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Rapid-acting insulin.</h3>
        <p>Rapid acting insulin (Humalog/Novolog/Ademelog/Fiasp)- needs to be calculated whenever your child eats and when blood sugar is elevated at meal- time and bedtim.</p>
        <p>We need rapid acting insulin for two reasons—for food and to correct a high blood sugar.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Insulin for food.</h3>
        <p>Foods with carbohydrates raise blood sugar and need insulin.There are two ways we can calculate insulin needed for food, using a carb ratio or a set insulin dose. Your diabetes doctor will tell you which method you’ll use to understand your insulin dose for food.</P>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
            <li>Insulin to carbohydrate ratio:
                <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                    <li>Knowledge of carb counting needed to accurately calculate dose.</li>
                    <li>Gives increased flexibility and accuracy to give insulin based on child’s normal meal pattern.</li>
                    <li>Your diabetes doctor will give you the ratio to use:
                        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
                            <li>unit of insulin for every ___ grams of carbohydrate in the food/meal.</li>
                            <li>Calculate carbs in meal and divide by ratio, see example below.</li>
                            <li>Example: Insulin to carbohydrate ratio is 1 unit for every 10 grams of carbohydrate. Child is eating 30 grams of carbohydrate.
                                1.1 unit for every 10 grams of carbohydrate for this meal=3 units of rapid acting insulin.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Set insulin dose for meals.
                <p>Some children take set doses of insulin for meals AND have general carbohydrate guidelines per meal Your diabetes doctor will let you know how many units of insulin to take with each meal.</p>
                <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                    <li>Your diabetes doctor will let you know how many units of insulin to take with each meal.</li>
                    <li>Example: Child takes 3 units of insulin for meals containing carbohydrates.</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Insulin for blood sugar.</h3>
        <p>There are two ways insulin can be given to bring down a high blood sugar—correction factor/insulin sensitivity and sliding scale.
            a.Your diabetes doctor will tell you which way is best for your family.</p>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
            <li>Correction factor insulin dosing:
                <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                    <li>Gives most precise dosing for high blood sugars.</li>
                    <li>Use for high blood sugars. Child’s diabetes doctor will set the blood sugar level where correction dosing needs to be given.</li>
                    <li>Examples for blood sugar over 150, use formula (BG-100)/50:
                        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
                            <li>Blood sugar is 300.</li>
                            <li>(300-100) =200.</li>
                            <li>200/50= 4 units. Child is to take 4 units IN ADDITION to meal dose for high blood sugar.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sliding scale dosing:
                    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                        <li>Use for high blood sugars.</li>
                        <li>Your diabetes doctor will tell you how much insulin to take for specific blood sugar ranges above target.</li>
                        <li>Example:</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
